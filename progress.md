# miden-code Implementation Progress

## Summary (2025-03-02)
We have successfully implemented Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the miden-code project. The core infrastructure and basic chat functionality are now in place. We have a working terminal-based chat UI that can interact with the Sonnet 3.7 LLM via the OpenRouter API.

Current status:
- Project structure is set up with Cargo
- Terminal UI is implemented using crossterm and ratatui
- Chat context management is implemented
- API client for Sonnet 3.7 LLM is implemented
- Basic shell and filesystem tools are defined but not yet integrated with the LLM

Next steps:
- Implement the integration between the LLM and the file system/shell tools
- Add user permission mechanisms for file and shell operations
- Implement file content display with syntax highlighting
- Enhance the UI with more features

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
